todo:
* dynamic length
* make compare1(), compare2(), and compare3() work
* improve confidence function
* early exit when an answer is already obvious (only one value should be considerably larger than everything else per iteration)
* implement backtracking
* launch a black-box process (e.g. auth.py) to do the authentication, and apply the timing attack on that
